Faith and Buffy are spending a LOT of time together this episode, and Jenny can't stop screaming about it. (Kristin is also excited but is playing it characteristically *cool.*)</p><p>Kristin has a fantastic talk with the lovely <strong>Jack Plotnick</strong>&nbsp;(portrayer of deputy mayor Allan!!), Buffering poet laureate <strong>Kate Leth</strong> delivers the greatest Buffy FashionWatch of all time, and <strong>Jess Abbott </strong>returns to voice Faith for an outlaw-country bad girls duet!
