        <![CDATA[<p>In December 1951, British philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote a piece for the NY Times Magazine titled <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/12/16/89825036.pdf">The Best Answer to Fanaticism &#8212; Liberalism</a> with a subhead that says &#8220;Its calm search for truth, viewed as dangerous in many places, remains the hope of humanity.&#8221; At the end of the article, he offers a list of ten commandments for living in the spirit of liberalism:</p>

<p>1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.</p>

<p>2. Do not think it worthwhile to produce belief by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.</p>

<p>3. Never try to discourage thinking, for you are sure to succeed.</p>

<p>4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.</p>

<p>5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.</p>

<p>6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.</p>

<p>7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.</p>

<p>8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.</p>

<p>9. Be scrupulously truthful, even when truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.</p>

<p>10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool&#8217;s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve found it increasingly difficult to keep an open mind about many issues, particularly on those related to politics. Remaining curious and generous about new & different ideas, especially in public, is perhaps more challenging than it was in Russell&#8217;s time. We are bombarded on all sides by propaganda, conspiracy theories, and broadly discredited theories from the past pushed upon us by entertainment news outlets and social media algorithms &#8212; we&#8217;re under a constant denial-of-service attack on our ability to think and reason.</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t reasonably be expected to give serious consideration to ideas like &#8220;the Holocaust didn&#8217;t happen&#8221;, &#8220;the Earth is flat&#8221;, &#8220;the Newtown massacre was faked&#8221;, &#8220;let&#8217;s try slavery again&#8221;, &#8220;vaccines cause autism&#8221;, and &#8220;anthropogenic climate change is a myth&#8221; &#8212; the evidence just doesn&#8217;t support any of it &#8212; but playing constant defense against all this crap makes it difficult to have good & important discussions with those we might disagree with about things like education, the role of national borders in a extremely mobile world, how to address our changing climate, systemic racism & discrimination, gun violence, healthcare, and dozens of other important issues. Perhaps with Russell&#8217;s guidelines in mind, we can make some progress on that front.</p>]]>

<p>Are you a mountains or a beach person? I prefer the beach &#8212; the ocean in particular, even though it scares the hell out of me sometimes. Photographer Rachael Talibart captures the power of the sea with <a href="https://www.rachaeltalibart.com/ocean">her photos of waves kicked up by storms</a>. She <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wave-photography/">spoke with Wired</a> about the project and her healthy respect for the ocean.</p>

<blockquote><p>Talibart still can&#8217;t help thinking of sea creatures when she looks at the photographs. Inspired by Homer&#8217;s Odyssey, she titled the series Sirens and gave each image the name of a mythological god or goddess. And although she avoids boats these days &#8212; she still gets seasick &#8212; Talibart credits her childhood sailing adventures with her ocean obsession.</p>

<p>&#8220;A part of me is still half-afraid of the sea,&#8221; she admits. &#8220;There&#8217;s a fascination and a love for it, but there&#8217;s also fear.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p>Cameras that can take usable photos in low light conditions <a href="https://kottke.org/17/04/incredible-low-light-camera-turns-night-into-day">are very useful</a> but very expensive. <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~cchen156/SID.html">A new paper</a> presented at this year&#8217;s IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition shows that training an AI to do image processing on low-light photos taken with a normal camera can yield amazing results. Here&#8217;s an image taken with a Sony a7S II, a really good low-light camera, and then corrected in the traditional way:</p>

<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/ai-image-iso-01.jpg" width="1000" height="670" border="0" alt="AI image in the dark" /></p>

<p>The colors are off and there&#8217;s a ton of noise. Here&#8217;s the same image, corrected by the AI program:</p>

<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/ai-image-iso-02.jpg" width="1000" height="670" border="0" alt="AI image in the dark" /></p>

<p>Pretty good, right? The effective ISO on these images has to be 1,000,000 or more. A short video shows more of their results:</p>

<p>For these two videos, FunWithGuru collected scenes from movies & TV that can trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response">ASMR</a>. He featured movies like Phantom Thread (rustling cloth) and Amelie (whispering) as well as well as calmer moments from more unlikely fare like Inglourious Basterds, Edward Scissorhands, and The Office. The clips show ASMR staples like calm talking, people quietly performing tasks, whispering, hair brushing, pouring water, and rustling paper.</p>]]>

<p>In his latest video, Evan Puschak compares the action scenes from Marvel and DC superhero movies and shows how DC comes up short. Some don&#8217;t appreciate all of the humor packed into Marvel&#8217;s films, but the DC movies take themselves WAY too seriously. And don&#8217;t even get me started on Zack Snyder &#8212; outside of 300, his take on action is not good. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that Snyder didn&#8217;t direct Wonder Woman, the best of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe#Wonder_Woman_(2017)">the DCEU films</a> in terms of action (and everything else).</p>

<p>Over 300 different people drew/illustrated moments from a real-life dance performance, which Kristen Lauth Shaeffer then assembled into one cool animated performance. This strongly reminds me of <a href="https://kottke.org/06/07/mesmerizing-clipart-movie-via-waxy">Oliver Laric&#8217;s clip-art animation</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>These posters designed by the NSA emphasizing the importance of security and secrecy to their employees are amazing. Declassified in mid-April 2018, most of the posters were produced in the 50s, 60s, and 70s and look as though they were cooked up by Salvador Dali or the Dadaists. Or even Mad Magazine. I mean:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The marshmallow test is a famous psychological experiment designed by Walter Mischel in the 1960s. Kids were given a single marshmallow but told they could have another if they refrained from eating the first one for 15 minutes. The results seemed to indicate a much greater degree of self-control amongst those children who were able to delay gratification, which led to better outcomes in their lives. From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/18/dont-2">a New Yorker article about Mischel</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once Mischel began analyzing the results, he noticed that low delayers, the children who rang the bell quickly, seemed more likely to have behavioral problems, both in school and at home. They got lower S.A.T. scores. They struggled in stressful situations, often had trouble paying attention, and found it difficult to maintain friendships. The child who could wait fifteen minutes had an S.A.T. score that was, on average, two hundred and ten points higher than that of the kid who could wait only thirty seconds.</p></blockquote>

<p>But Mischel only tested ~90 kids from a single preschool. Researchers from UC Irvine and NYU recently redid the test with more kids that were more representative of the general population and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/">found that household income was a big factor in explaining both the ability to delay and outcomes</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the new study finds limited support for the idea that being able to delay gratification leads to better outcomes. Instead, it suggests that the capacity to hold out for a second marshmallow is shaped in large part by a child&#8217;s social and economic background &#8212; and, in turn, that that background, not the ability to delay gratification, is what&#8217;s behind kids&#8217; long-term success.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you&#8217;re poor, you might look at the promise of future food somewhat dubiously&#8230;and not because of a lack of self-control:</p>

<blockquote><p>The failed replication of the marshmallow test does more than just debunk the earlier notion; it suggests other possible explanations for why poorer kids would be less motivated to wait for that second marshmallow. For them, daily life holds fewer guarantees: There might be food in the pantry today, but there might not be tomorrow, so there is a risk that comes with waiting. And even if their parents promise to buy more of a certain food, sometimes that promise gets broken out of financial necessity.</p></blockquote>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>This is an excerpt from <a href="https://mailchi.mp/kottke/noticing-at-the-end-of-the-dial-tone-06012018">this week&#8217;s edition of Noticing</a>, Kottke.org&#8217;s newsletter. </em></p>

<p>Alexis Madrigal wrote movingly about the death of 20th century telephone culture in &#8220;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/ring-ring-ring-ring/561545/">Why No One Answers Their Phone Anymore</a>.&#8221; A combination of more media options, a glut of robo-calls, and the transformation of the telephone technology itself, with caller IDs, individual rather than household numbers, and mutable ringtones have changed not just a communication medium, but a way of life. And it&#8217;s part of a pattern of shifting media use from real-time to my-time. (When this first emerged, I used to call it TiVo Time.)</p>

<p>I wonder though, whether telephone culture has died or it&#8217;s metastasized. Madrigal writes: &#8220;When you called someone, if the person was there, they would pick up, they would say hello. If someone called you, if you were there, you would pick up, you would say hello. That was just how phones worked. The expectation of pickup was what made phones a synchronous medium.&#8221; </p>

<p>Avital Ronell, a wonky writer/philosopher I read a lot back in my grad school days, writes in <em>The Telephone Book</em> (1989) about the always-on nature of the telephone as a key element of its mode of being. &#8220;Respond as you would to the telephone, for the call of the telephone is incessant and unremitting. When you hang up, it does not disappear but goes into remission&#8230;. There is no off switch to the technological.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is now basically our state all the time! Not exclusively on the telephone, but on at least one of the electrical vibrations of telecommunications, everywhere we go, every minute of every day. </p>

<p>So it&#8217;s almost as if we&#8217;re now <em>always</em> on the telephone. A ring is like a call waiting notification that we can acknowledge or ignore. And most of the time, now, many of us ignore it. But only on the rarest occasions do we ignore the entire electronic hum. That&#8217;s where most of us live now.</p>

    <title>The last survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riots</title>

<p>The history of the United States is a history of racial plunder, specifically whites plundering the property of nonwhites. It&#8217;s extremely difficult to build wealth across generations when gangs can burn down your farm or shoot up your banks without repercussions. </p>

<p>This is why the 1921 Tulsa Riots are so essential to American history, because it might be the starkest event of extralegal white plunder apart from the Trail of Tears. NPR managed to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/05/31/615546965/meet-the-last-surviving-witness-to-the-tulsa-race-riot-of-1921">interview Olivia Hooker</a>, who was six years old at the time of the riots. She is probably the last surviving witness.</p>

<blockquote><p>In less than 24 hours, the white mobs destroyed more than 1,000 homes and businesses. They set fire to schools, churches, libraries, and movie theaters, leveling entire city blocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s store was destroyed,&#8221; Hooker says. &#8220;There was nothing left but one big safe. It was so big they couldn&#8217;t carry it away, so they had to leave it &#8212; in the middle of the rubble.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Fires had been started by the white invaders soon after 1 o&#8217;clock and other fires were set from time to time. By 8 o&#8217;clock practically the entire thirty blocks of homes in the negro quarters were in flames and few buildings escaped destruction. Negroes caught in their burning homes were in many instances shot down as they attempted to escape.&#8221;<em><br />
    &#8212; The New York Times, June 2, 1921</p>

<p>Reports varied wildly. Initial estimates put the death toll somewhere between 36 and 85. One report, released by Maurice Willows who directed the American Red Cross relief efforts, estimated that as many as 300 people were killed. Today, the Tulsa Race Riot is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hooker went on to get a doctorate in psychology and founded the Tulsa Race Riot Commission in 1997 to make a case for reparations. She&#8217;s now 103 years old.</p>]]>

    <title>How to make grilled cheese</title>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of different recipes for simple food dishes &#8212; Jose Andres&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/09/12/dining/20120912-SPANISH.html">The Perfectly Fried Egg</a>&#8221; changed the way I cook just about everything &#8212; and this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017326-grilled-cheese-sandwich">deconstructed-then-reconstructed take on grilled cheese</a> fits right in with that glorious recipe.<br />
    <blockquote><ol><br />
	<li>Heat a heavy pan over medium-low heat.</li><li>Thinly spread one side of each bread slice with butter. Spread the other side of each slice with mayonnaise and place the bread, mayonnaise-side-down, in the pan. Divide the cheese evenly on top of the buttered slices. Adjust the heat so the bread sizzles gently.</li><li>When the cheese is about halfway melted, use a spatula to flip one slice over on top of the other, and press lightly to melt. Keep turning the sandwich, pressing gently, until the sandwich is compact, both sides are crusty, and the cheese is melted.</li></ol></blockquote><br />
Personally, I would omit the mayonnaise and brush the down sides of the bread with olive oil instead: it gives the bread a nice cripsyness and none of that mayonnaise flavor. (I&#8217;m cool with mayo most of the time, but not on my grilled cheese.)</p>]]>

Ask Questions At Me</a>&#8221; is one of the bleakest, funniest, most existentially absurd things I have ever read. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s structured like a Reddit AMA, so you have to read through the comments to get to the good bits, and the accumulative effect is bigger than any one punchline. A sample:</p>

<blockquote><p>I got fired from my Pepsi job because one of my coworkers stuck a sign on my back that said &#8220;PROUD MURDERER OF JONBENET RAMSEY,&#8221; and the regional supervisor who was visiting that day took it at face value. I did not discover the sign until the following week, when I wore the same shirt again to a custody hearing and the judge cited it as justification for denying me visitation rights. Unfortunately, the sign on my back was perceived as a murder confession, and the company apparently reserves the right to withhold severance if termination comes as a result of criminal activity. So no severance for ol&#8217; Ronald.</p>

<p>Sadly, the day I got fired was also the day of my 30th anniversary at Pepsi, and when my boss called me into his office I thought he was going to honor me. That was not the case.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ronald also tries to get a dog to cheer himself up (he loses his beloved family dog in the divorce), but turns out to be allergic to it; the shelter refuses to take the dog back because &#8220;it they said &#8216;smelled too much like me.&#8217;&#8221; He chats up workers at the cellular phone stall so he can have human contact and reminisce about having a family plan. If this kind of black humor does anything for you, trust me, you should check this out. </p>

<p>As Matt Novak <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1001934844413136897">tweeted</a>, &#8220;I&#8217;d just like to say that Nick Denton would be very proud if he had lived to see Kinja used like this. Clickhole is amazing. RIP Nick Denton.&#8221;</p>]]>

<p>There is much to admire in how Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s movies are constructed, but the director&#8217;s keen compositional eye is perhaps the most noticeable. Before becoming a filmmaker, Kubrick honed his observational skills as a photographer in NYC. Look magazine hired him when he was just 17 years old to fill the pages of the publication with photos of life in the city. A new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/383657232X/ref=nosim/0sil8">Stanley Kubrick Photographs: Through a Different Lens</a>, celebrates Kubrick&#8217;s photography, showcasing how that youthful talent would eventually translate into a great filmmaking career.</p>

<blockquote><p>Through a Different Lens reveals the keen and evocative vision of a burgeoning creative genius in a range of feature stories and images, from everyday folk at the laundromat to a day in the life of a debutant, from a trip to the circus to Columbia University. Featuring around 300 images, many previously unseen, as well as rare Look magazine tear sheets, this release coincides with a major show at the Museum of the City of New York and includes an introduction by noted photography critic Luc Sante.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kubrick&#8217;s photos are also <a href="http://www.mcny.org/exhibition/through-different-lens">on display at the Museum of the City of New York</a> until late October 2018.</p>]]>

<p>One of the recurrent topics here at the ol&#8217; dot org is paying our respects to people who are mind-bendingly good at what they do. Case in point: watch this woman turn a magic scarf into about 100 different pieces of clothing in about 90 seconds. Reader, I audibly gasped at ~0:25 when she turned a scarf into a dress in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>This extraordinary garment has been compared to a Thneed, a fictional garment from Dr. Seuss&#8217; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394823370/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Lorax</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.<br />
A Thneed&#8217;s a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!<br />
It&#8217;s a shirt. It&#8217;s a sock. It&#8217;s a glove. It&#8217;s a hat.<br />
But it has OTHER uses. Yes, far beyond that.<br />
You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!<br />
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There are <a href="https://amzn.to/2JfTljU">quite a few magic scarves available for purchase on Amazon</a> if you want to try one out for yourself, but check those seller ratings&#8230;some of them look a little sketchy. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/dunstan">@dunstan</a>)</p>]]>

What, you had a late-career single make 41? Sorry, thanks for playing, but charting 41 isn&#8217;t the same as 40, right? Um, no &#8230; maybe? It gets no easier when you have to wade through dozens of other Billboard charts that count for everything except, apparently, determining a one-hit wonder. And what about all those charts in other countries &#8212; yeah, we ignored them. Great, this list is making us xenophobic now.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s getting pretty damn technical, and we&#8217;re not numbers people here. Because, technically, Beck is a one-hit wonder. As are the Grateful Dead and even Radiohead if they hadn&#8217;t snuck in at 37 with &#8220;Nude&#8221; back in 2008. Very lucky, Mr. Yorke. Can you imagine if you scrolled through a list of the 100 Best One-Hit Wonder Songs and found Beck sitting at the top spot? You&#8217;d collectively crash our site&#8217;s server in a contest to see which commenter could say the cruelest thing about our music knowledge, mothers, and cats.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Technically, Beck is a one-hit wonder.&#8221; Also, I feel that Sir Mix-a-Lot should have made the list.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Given the recent Netflix-driven Cambrian explosion in television shows, there is no Best Show On TV&trade; anymore. But over the past few years, even with so many other excellent shows to choose from, The Americans had a legitimate claim to that title. In <a href="https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/the-americans-series-finale-recap-start-review-spoilers/">his review of last night&#8217;s final show</a> (spoilers ahoy!), Alan Sepinwall nails what made the show so compelling to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Priority-wise, The Americans has always been a show about marriage that used the spycraft to heighten the stakes, rather than an espionage drama that used the family material to make Philip and Elizabeth more relatable. Its chief interest was in the compromises necessary to make any long-term relationship work, about the disagreements every pair of spouses will have about career and parenting and everything else. The assassinations, honeypots, and Stan&#8217;s investigations provided narrative propulsion and suspense, and Soviet ideology was at the heart of every choice Elizabeth made, particularly when it came to Paige, but all of that was thematically secondary to husband/wife and parent/child issues.</p></blockquote>

<p>As I noted in my recent <a href="https://kottke.org/18/05/my-media-diet-for-spring-2018">media diet post</a>, their final season has been very strong, and the series finale held true to the show&#8217;s focus on family in an unexpectedly quiet and powerful way.</p>

<blockquote><p>Could the series have ended with some combination of Jenningses killed or behind bars for life? Certainly, and it wouldn&#8217;t have rang false if it had happened. But the fact that the finale&#8217;s tragedies are all small-scale and family-related &#8212; Elizabeth and Philip abandon one child and are abandoned by the other, Stan learns that his best friend has been betraying him for years, and that his wife may be betraying him in the same way &#8212; feels in keeping with all that we&#8217;ve seen before.</p></blockquote>

<p>I loved the finale &#8212; Stan&#8217;s devastation in particular ruined me&#8230;I&#8217;m going to be thinking about that for a long while &#8212; and Sepinwall&#8217;s recap is typically great. He also <a href="https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/the-americans-finale-interview-creators-spoilers/">interviewed the show&#8217;s creators about the episode</a>, who maddeningly (but correctly, I grudgingly have to admit) won&#8217;t spill the beans on what happens to any of the characters after the events of the show. Other recaps: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/arts/television/finale-the-americans-recap.html">NY Times</a>, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/the-americans-series-finale-review.html">Vulture</a>, <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/the-americans-ends-as-it-lived-tense-affecting-and-o-1826435707">AV Club</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to catch up, all six seasons of The Americans <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B8PCLTY/ref=nosim/0sil8">are available on Amazon</a> (1-5 are Prime, 6 isn&#8217;t yet).</p>]]>

<p>From the Atlantic, a quick visual history of human-created light sources over the past ~400,000 years, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/560585/visual-history-light/">from wood fires to candles to the electric light</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>3,000 BCE: The &#8220;rushlight&#8221; candle is invented in Ancient Egypt. It is made of a pithy stalk of rush soaked in animal fat.</p>

<p>1500 BCE: Babylonian/Assyrian lamps are created from olive or sesame oil. They had a linen wick and were fashioned from stone, terracotta, metal, or shells.</p>

<p>100 CE: The Romans create the tallow candle, which has a small wick with a thick, hand-formed layer of tallow.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the more interesting inventions along the way was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/tower-of-light-when-electricity-was-new-people-used-it-to-mimic-the-moon/273445/">the moonlight tower</a>. In the early days of electric lights, mimicking the bright light of the Moon was one of the ways that towns chose to light their streets.</p>

<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/moonlight-tower.jpg" width="1000" height="654" border="0" alt="Moonlight Tower" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Humans, too, found the high-slung orbs to be as disorienting as they were ethereal. As tall as the towers were, they still left shadows in their wake &#8212; shadows tinged with sharp blue light, Freeberg notes, which left pedestrians &#8220;dazed and puzzled.&#8221; Foggy evenings, combined with the air pollution of a newly industrialized America, could thrust all of Detroit into effective darkness &#8212; meaning, Freeberg writes, that &#8220;Detroiters could only speculate about the lovely sight that their lights must be creating as they shone down on the blanket of mist and soot that smothered the city.&#8221; Even during occasions when the fog broke enough to allow some light to penetrate to the streets below, &#8220;many found themselves groping along sidewalks in an eerie gloom.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the end, the many costs of the artificial moonlight outweighed its beauty and poetry. The structures meant to inspire awe among outsiders ended up inspiring, ultimately, something more akin to pity. (&#8220;It appears to me,&#8221; one frank observer put it, &#8220;that you are taking a very expensive way of getting a minimum benefit from the electric lights.&#8221;)</p></blockquote>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>BBC Culture recently polled authors, journalists, and other literary types from 35 different countries and asked them &#8220;to nominate up to five fictional stories they felt had shaped mindsets or influenced history&#8221;. From the responses, they compiled <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-100-stories-that-shaped-the-world">a list of 100 stories that shaped the world</a>. Here&#8217;s the top 5:</p>

<p>5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141023384/ref=nosim/0sil8">Things Fall Apart</a> (Chinua Achebe, 1958)<br />
4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451524934/ref=nosim/0sil8">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> (George Orwell, 1949)<br />
3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486282112/ref=nosim/0sil8">Frankenstein</a> (Mary Shelley, 1818)<br />
2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486440281/ref=nosim/0sil8">Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</a> (Harriet Beecher Stowe, 1852)<br />
1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393089053/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Odyssey</a> (Homer, 8th Century BC)</p>

<p>The Harry Potter series, The Epic of Gilgamesh, and Jane Eyre are also included in the top 20. Oddly, the Hebrew Bible, Christian Bible, Koran, and other religious texts are nowhere to be found on the list. A story like the four gospels of the New Testament has surely changed the world much more than all of the other titles on the list combined.

<p>Chantel Tattoli&#8217;s piece for The Paris Review, <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/05/15/the-surprising-history-and-future-of-fingerprints">The Surprising History (and Future) of Fingerprints</a>, is interesting throughout, but these two things leapt from the screen (italics mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>It is true that every print is unique to every finger, even for identical twins, who share the same genetic code. <em>Fingerprints are formed by friction from touching the walls of our mother&#8217;s womb.</em> Sometimes they are called &#8220;chanced impressions.&#8221; By Week 19, about four months before we are issued into the world, they are set.</p></blockquote>

<p>WHAT?! Is this true? A cursory search shows this might indeed be the case, although it looks as though there&#8217;s not established scientific consensus around the process.</p>

<p>Also, Picasso was fingerprinted as a suspect in the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre:</p>

<blockquote><p>When French authorities interrogated Pablo Picasso, in 1911, at the Palais de Justice about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre that August, he was clad in his favorite red-and-white polka-dot shirt. Picasso cried. He begged forgiveness. He was in possession of two statuettes filched from the museum, but he hadn&#8217;t taken her.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In possession of&#8221;? Turns out a pal of Picasso&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-picasso-trial-stealing-mona-lisa">lifted the statuettes from the museum</a>, which was notoriously easy to steal from, and sold them to the artist, who knew exactly what he was buying.</p>

<blockquote><p>True to Pieret&#8217;s testimony, Picasso kept two stolen Iberian statues buried in a cupboard in his Paris apartment. Despite the artist&#8217;s later protestations of ignorance there could be no mistaking their origins. The bottom of each was stamped in bold: PROPERTY OF THE MUS&Eacute;E DU LOUVRE.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, many people today seem to take great licence with the right to believe, flouting their responsibility. The wilful ignorance and false knowledge that are commonly defended by the assertion &#8216;I have a right to my belief&#8217; do not meet James&#8217;s requirements. Consider those who believe that the lunar landings or the Sandy Hook school shooting were unreal, government-created dramas; that Barack Obama is Muslim; that the Earth is flat; or that climate change is a hoax. In such cases, the right to believe is proclaimed as a negative right; that is, its intent is to foreclose dialogue, to deflect all challenges; to enjoin others from interfering with one&#8217;s belief-commitment. The mind is closed, not open for learning. They might be &#8216;true believers&#8217;, but they are not believers in the truth.</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>(A version of this story is an <a href="https://mailchi.mp/kottke/noticing-cheaters-monopoly-is-the-game-for-our-time-5252018">excerpt from this week&#8217;s Noticing newsletter</a>. You can <a href="http://kottke.org/newsletter">read more about Noticing here</a>.) </em></p>

<p>In a rare interview, Italian author Elena Ferrante observes that between corruption, poverty, violence, fear, and the deterioration of democracy, &#8220;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-elena-ferrante-interview-20180517-htmlstory.html">today it seems to me that the whole world is Naples</a> and that Naples has the merit of having always presented itself without a mask.&#8221; The world of Ferrante&#8217;s novels is the world in which we&#8217;ve all been living; the rest of us are just catching up to what Neapolitans have known all along.</p>

<p>It seems you could make a similar case for The Onion in the time of Trump: the world was already absurd and buffoonish, and now it&#8217;s taken off its mask. It does make telling jokes a touch more tricky. Editor-in-chief Chad Nackers <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/20/donald-trump-onion-stories-597809">explains the site&#8217;s approach</a>, admitting that the writers&#8217; job would probably be easier if Hillary Clinton had been elected. </p>

<p>What strikes me is how much he attributes to the site&#8217;s changes over the years isn&#8217;t to the administration, but to the atmosphere, which has changed since the days of Bill Clinton (and not just because of who&#8217;s been elected since).</p>

<blockquote>When I started, there weren&#8217;t really too many humor sites. There definitely weren&#8217;t any humor news sites. A lot of times, nobody else was going to get their comment out as fast as we were going to get it out, by virtue of us having a website. Now it almost seems like on Twitter there are people who are professional comedians who are online all day. A story breaks and they&#8217;re making jokes about it.</blockquote>

<p>Andy Baio recently <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/999699093277442048">posted</a> a link that shows you your <a href="https://t.co/41a6iQcYhc">Twitter timeline as it would have looked ten years ago</a> if you followed all the same people that you do today. For me, at least, it&#8217;s amazing how different the tone is &#8212; even in the middle of an historic election, in the early stages of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">enormous economic meltdown</a>, there&#8217;s a lot less politics, a lot less sniping, and a lot more diaristic writing. It&#8217;s not necessarily better; it&#8217;s just very different. And all of those things were happening then &#8212; it&#8217;s just that Twitter wasn&#8217;t understood as the venue where every stance was to be articulated, every statement was to be critiqued, and every line was to be drawn. There were fewer people around, it was a lot more homogenous, and far fewer people were paying attention.</p>

<p>I wonder often how future historians will think about this time (you know, with the usual grisly caveat that people survive to do history in the future): how much of today&#8217;s ugliness, violence, and corruption they will think of as an aberration of one man, or one family, one political party, one social media network, one television network, etc. </p>

<p>Or will they see it as an interlocking, self-contradictory system, all of which had a history, and all of whose parts shaped and enabled what happened &#8212; hopefully, good and bad things. I mean, even the people who&#8217;ve argued that <a href="https://kottke.org/18/05/the-coup-has-already-happened">the coup has already happened</a> can&#8217;t agree on whether it began with the election, with Congress, or some time long before. </p>

<p>Maybe the future historians will be better at disentangling these things than we are. Or maybe we&#8217;re just all hopelessly tangled.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Monica Heisey was recently stuck on an airplane without much to do. Luckily, she made an essay out of it. &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/s/in-defense-of-the-worst-human-emotions/being-bored-is-fun-and-good-sorry-d6087151ef03">Being Bored Is Fun and Good, Sorry</a>&#8221; is (surprisingly?) crackling with energy and insight. </p>

<blockquote>In 2018, it is easy and common to be tired, depressed, burnt out, dulled, vibrating with mundane panic, desperate for the sweet release of death, etc. But to be peacefully understimulated with no relief in sight is almost impossible. The average person&#8217;s life is full of little tasks to complete, group chats to respond &#8220;haha, yeah&#8221; to, emails to circle back on, and people you went to high school with to determinedly ignore on the bus. The entire world is one giant beeping alert to things we should do or can do or will do in the future, things we are doing at that moment but could be doing faster. It&#8217;s more or less impossible to be bored. Bored means there are not thousands of to-do&#8217;s to accomplish. Bored means it doesn&#8217;t matter that there&#8217;s not. Bored means you are free. In a time of endless, empty stimuli, it is a thrill to be understimulated.</blockquote>

<p>That said, I feel like there&#8217;s something of a bait-and-switch here. There&#8217;s boredom, which for me is defined by the frustration at having nothing appealing to do, and then there&#8217;s a lack of busyness or stimulation, which offers the possibility of a zen-like moment that transcends that frustration. We might call them both boredom, but they&#8217;re really not the same thing. But this is splitting hairs. The point is, opportunities for boredom can also be opportunities to be something better than busy, if you approach them the right way.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Science writer Carl Zimmer has a new book on genetics and heredity called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101984597/ref=nosim/0sil8">She Has Her Mother&#8217;s Laugh</a></em>. The New York Times published an excerpt this week focusing on mosaicism &#8212; an unexpected but surprisingly common condition where different cells in the same organism display different DNA (sometimes strikingly, fatally different).</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Walsh and his colleagues have discovered intricate mosaics in the brains of healthy people. In one study, they plucked neurons from the brain of a 17-year-old boy who had died in a car accident. They sequenced the DNA in each neuron and compared it to the DNA in cells from the boy&#8217;s liver, heart and lungs.</p>

<p>Every neuron, the researchers found, had hundreds of mutations not found in the other organs. But many of the mutations were shared only by some of the other neurons.</p>

<p>It occurred to Dr. Walsh that he could use the mutations to reconstruct the cell lineages &#8212; to learn how they had originated. The researchers used the patterns to draw a sort of genealogy, linking each neuron first to its close cousins and then its more distant relatives.</p>

<p>When they had finished, the scientists found that the cells belonged to five main lineages. The cells in each lineage all inherited the same distinctive mosaic signature.</p>

<p>Even stranger, the scientists found cells in the boy&#8217;s heart with the same signature of mutations found in some brain neurons. Other lineages included cells from other organs.</p>

<p>Based on these results, the researchers pieced together <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4664477">a biography of the boy&#8217;s brain</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been drawn to the idea that <a href="https://twitter.com/tcarmody/status/651181060558974976">each of us are many people</a>, an assembly of mismatched parts, manifesting themselves in different times and contexts. It&#8217;s striking to see that reflected, albeit in a refracted way, in our array of possible genomes.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>On the heels of Texas&#8217;s lieutenant governor blaming school shootings on &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/19/texas-official-says-that-fewer-doors-could-mean-fewer-school-shootings-we-had-experts-weigh-in/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.33da028e8487">too many entrances and too many exits</a>&#8221; in buildings, 99% Invisible producer Avery Trufelman linked to this episode on <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/good-egress/">the architectural history of egress</a>, or orderly escape from a building in the case of a fire or some other emergency.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, most fire escapes were simple ropes:</p>

<blockquote><p>One engineer actually thought that, instead of dispatching the ropes from indoors, archers could shoot the ropes up to the higher floors.</p>

<p>Another patent proposed individual parachute hats, with accompanying rubber shoes to break the fall.</p>

<p>There were also fire escape slides, which were marketed to schools as both emergency devices and playground equipment.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/fireescapeslide.jpg" width="600" height="427"  border="0" alt="fireescapeslide.jpg" /></p>

<p>Even the iconic metal fire escapes attached to tenement buildings are a pretty poor form of egress; they&#8217;re not accessible, and since people generally don&#8217;t use them to enter or exit a building in normal circumstances, they don&#8217;t know how to locate or use them in a fire. Which is how we get to stairs behind a fire door, with clear, lit-up exits, as the main means of egress for tall buildings today. And nonresidential buildings like schools, hospitals, and commercial buildings have the strictest ratings and the most effective means of escape &#8212; which is a big part of why so few people die in fires in these buildings. </p>

<p>Who would have thought a little regulation and a modern, scientific approach could save so many lives?</p>]]>

<p>When commissioned to create some artwork for a London music duo, Tim Easley spent 80 hours making <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/64821947/Modified-Man">this model circuit board out of plasticine clay</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea behind the cover was how the modified men of the future may make artwork out of ancient circuit boards, not quite understanding what they were for because of their crude appearance. For this I created a design with representations of computer chips and wires.</p></blockquote>

<p>He then photographed the results for an album cover and other printed matter. (via <a href="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/05/an-intricate-circuit-board-formed-with-thousands-of-miniature-modeling-clay-pieces-by-tim-easley/">colossal</a>)</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping track of every media thing I &#8220;consume&#8221;, so here are quick reviews of some things I&#8217;ve read, seen, heard, and experienced in the past month or so. I went to Florida with my kids and we did the Harry Potter thing at Universal & visited the Space Coast. I stopped watching Mr. Robot s03 after two episodes. Still making my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005HEVBGG/ref=nosim/0sil8">Star Trek: Voyager</a> when I want something uncomplicated to watch in the evening. (Ignore the letter grades, they suck.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07BDFTN2T/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Americans</a>. This season, the show&#8217;s last, has been <em>fantastic</em>. It&#8217;s idiotic to say The Americans is the best show on TV with like 50,000 shows on Netflix alone, but after five strong seasons and this finish, they&#8217;ve earned it. (A)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rebelgirls.co/pages/podcast-1">Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls: The Podcast</a>. <a href="https://kottke.org/18/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-in-audio-format">I wrote an appreciation of this</a> a few weeks ago. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1524761435/ref=nosim/0sil8">Am I There Yet?</a> by Mari Andrew. I love Andrew&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bymariandrew/">Instagram feed</a> but even so, her book surprised me with timeless and universal themes woven into her life story. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hulu.com/the-handmaids-tale">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</a>. The first season of this show was great and season two picks up right where it left off. I binged the first six episodes of this across two nights and came away shellshocked. (A)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80145240">Wild Wild Country</a>. Not sure why anyone followed the Bhagwan anywhere, but Sheela on the other hand&#8230; There were several interesting threads in this documentary that didn&#8217;t quite get pulled together in the final episode. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/universal-orlando-resort/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter/hub/index.html">The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida</a>. The tickets for this were incredibly expensive and worth every damn penny. This was very nearly a religious experience. (A+)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B078JPXYFL/ref=nosim/0sil8">Downsizing</a>. I wanted more from this about the implications of the evolution of humans into <a href="https://kottke.org/16/09/meet-the-nano-sapiens">nano sapiens</a>. Still, better than many critics & audiences suggested. (B)</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brain-it-on-physics-puzzles/id985367692?mt=8?mt=8&amp;at=11l7dq&amp;ct=blog">Brain It On</a>. I saw my daughter playing this physics puzzler on her iPad and basically grabbed it away from her and played for 24 straight hours. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hbo.com/westworld">Westworld</a>. Watching this every week feels like a chore. Even though the safeties are off, everything that happens in the parks feels consequence-free. I don&#8217;t care about the robots. Should I? (C+)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009EEQAT8/ref=nosim/0sil8">Fantastic Mr. Fox</a>. Stop-motion animation might be Anderson&#8217;s natural medium because he can shoot everything *exactly* like he wants. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.isleofdogsmovie.com/">Isle of Dogs</a>. Loved this. The style of it made me want to design something amazing. I could have watched the sushi-making scene for like 15 more minutes. (A)</p>

<p><a href="https://craigmod.com/onmargins/004/">On Margins - The Making of Rebel Girls</a>. Craig Mod talks to co-creator Elena Favilli about how <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0757X8GWM/ref=nosim/0sil8">Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</a> came about and came to be so successful. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="http://restaurantlexpress.com/en/">L&#8217;Express</a>. A classic Montreal restaurant. Best steak frites I&#8217;ve had in a long while. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80136321">Babylon Berlin</a>. Super stylish. The dance scene in the second episode is amazing. The best things about the show are <a href="https://kottke.org/18/04/music-from-babylon-berlin">the music</a> and the world-building in the first few episodes. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07B8NGLWD/ref=nosim/0sil8">Death of Stalin</a>. I love that people still make films like this. Most of the audience I saw this with had no idea what to make of it or why a few people were laughing so hard at some parts. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/">Kennedy Space Center</a>. The <a href="https://kottke.org/17/08/my-2017-total-solar-eclipse-trip">solar eclipse</a> last summer awakened the space/astronomy nerd in me, so this visit was incredible. We saw a Space Shuttle, a Saturn V rocket, the VAB, and a whole mess of other great things. Thinking of going back for their <a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/camps-and-education/astronaut-training-experience">Astronaut Training Experience</a>. (A+)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War">Avengers: Infinity War</a>. The ending of this left me stunned&#8230;it broke the fourth wall in a unique way. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(film)">A Quiet Place</a>. This entire movie is a metaphor for trying to keep small children quiet on a long plane flight. (B)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735211752/ref=nosim/0sil8">Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet</a> by Claire Evans. This book demonstrates that telling the story of technology, programming, and the internet mainly through the many women who helped build it all is just as plausible and truthful as telling the traditionally women-free tale we&#8217;ve typically been exposed to. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="https://kottke.org/18/05/the-songs-of-the-years-1925-2018">Songs of the Years, 1925-2018</a>. So glad this playlist is back in my life. (A-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009GEEMLY/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Avengers</a>. I&#8217;d forgotten where all the Infinity Stones came from, so I&#8217;ve gone back and watched this, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the first Thor movie. Fascinating to see the changes in the filmmaking and pacing. If Infinity War had been made with the pace of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005H9B2CE/ref=nosim/0sil8">Thor</a> (directed by Kenneth Branagh!), it would have been 5 hours long. (B+)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html">Caliphate</a>. Gripping and disturbing and very nearly a must-listen. But I keep showing up places shellshocked after listening to it in the car. (A)</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.astronomerswithoutborders.org/products/awb-onesky-reflector-telescope">AWB OneSky Reflector Telescope</a>. When I looked through this for the first time <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjD_QZyBDBk/">at the Moon</a>, my first thought was &#8220;WHOA&#8221;. My second was &#8220;I should have bought a more powerful telescope&#8221;. Luckily I can just buy more lenses for it&#8230; (A)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this for <a href="https://kottke.org/17/04/some-things-ive-read-seen-and-heard-in-the-past-few-months">more than a year</a> now! Past installments of my media diet <a href="https://kottke.org/tag/media%20diet">can be found here</a>.</p>]]>

<p>Hasbro has come out with an official &#8220;Cheaters Edition&#8221; of Monopoly (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0771YL7DZ/ref=nosim/0sil8">available at Amazon</a>) where popular game cheats like stealing money from the bank, busting out of jail early, and taking a hotel from another player have been added to the gameplay. <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90172834/50-of-monopoly-players-cheat-so-hasbro-redesigned-it-for-them">Fast Company has more</a> on how the game came to be.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had this data for years. 50% of all Monopoly players cheat,&#8221; says Randy Klimpert, Hasbro&#8217;s senior director of design and games development. This fact of life was always something of a running joke within the walls of Hasbro. It became the giggly fodder of proposed ad campaigns. Employees got a kick out of listening to the messages left on its holiday helpline, established in 2016, to help families settle disputes in their games and address accusations of creative cheating. &#8220;We were literally sitting around thinking, &#8216;what would really corrupt Monopoly?&#8217; And someone said, &#8216;what if we cheated?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our senior marketer&#8230; you could see him mulling it,&#8221; Klimpert continues. &#8220;Monopoly&#8230; cheaters&#8230; Cheater Edition!&#8221; Hasbro instantly had the hook for a new game. But how do you make a game for cheaters that&#8217;s still sensical and fun?</p></blockquote>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Using simple graphic representations of annual temperatures (like <a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/998910476103897088">this one</a> posted by climate scientist Ed Hawkins), people are knitting and crocheting blankets that show just how warm the Earth has gotten over the past few decades. See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/katie.stumpf.1/posts/10155566032245056">Katie Stumpf&#8217;s blanket</a>, for example.</p>

<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/global-warming-blankets.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" border="0" alt="Global Warming Blankets" /></p>

<p><a href="https://elliehighwood.com/2017/06/12/climatechangecrochet-the-global-warming-blanket/">According to climate scientist (and crocheter) Ellie Highwood</a>, these blankets are a subset of &#8220;temperature blankets&#8221; made to represent, for example, daily temperatures over the course of a year in a particular location. The blanket she crocheted used NOAA data of global mean temperature anomalies for a 101-year period ending 2016.</p>

<blockquote><p>I then devised a colour scale using 15 different colours each representing a 0.1 &deg;C data bin. So everything between 0 and 0.099 was in one colour for example. Making a code for these colours, the time series can be rewritten as in the table below. It is up to the creator to then choose the colours to match this scale, and indeed which years to include. I was making a baby sized blanket so chose the last 100 years, 1916-2016.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you read <a href="https://elliehighwood.com/2017/06/12/climatechangecrochet-the-global-warming-blanket/">her post</a>, she provides instructions for making your own global warming blanket.</p>

<p>P.S. You might think that with the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere getting warmer on average, these blankets would ironically be less necessary that they would have been 50 years ago. But climate change is also responsible for <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/perfect-storm-extreme-winter-weather-bitter-cold-and-climate-change">more extreme winter weather events</a> &#8212; think global weirding in addition to global warming. So keep those blankets handy!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sopan Deb recently sat down with some of the cast of Arrested Development (Jeffrey Tambor, Tony Hale, Jason Bateman, Alia Shawkat, Jessica Walter, Will Arnett, and David Cross) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/television/arrested-development-netflix-interview-jeffrey-tambor.html">for an interview</a> about the show&#8217;s upcoming new season. Deb asked the group about <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/lines-got-blurred-jeffrey-tambor-an-up-close-look-at-harassment-claims-transparent-1108939">the allegations against Tambor related to his work on Transparent</a>, and Walter (who plays Lucille Bluth on the show) begins to cry as the men in the room, particularly Bateman, offer explanations for Tambor&#8217;s on-set verbal abuse of her.</p>

<blockquote><p>BATEMAN: Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, &#8220;difficult.&#8221; And when you&#8217;re in a privileged position to hire people, or have an influence in who does get hired, you make phone calls. And you say, &#8220;Hey, so I&#8217;ve heard X about person Y, tell me about that.&#8221; And what you learn is context. And you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it&#8217;s a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It&#8217;s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.</p>

<p>SHAWKAT: But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s acceptable. And the point is that things are changing, and people need to respect each other differently.</p>

<p>WALTER [THROUGH TEARS]: Let me just say one thing that I just realized in this conversation. I have to let go of being angry at him. He never crossed the line on our show, with any, you know, sexual whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize. I have to let it go. [Turns to Tambor.] And I have to give you a chance to, you know, for us to be friends again.</p>

<p>TAMBOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>WALTER: But it&#8217;s hard because honestly &#8212; Jason says this happens all the time. In like almost 60 years of working, I&#8217;ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it&#8217;s hard to deal with, but I&#8217;m over it now. I just let it go right here, for The New York Times.</p></blockquote>

<p>Walter stated that Tambor apologized, but none of the men in the room said anything as simple as &#8220;that was inappropriate&#8221; or &#8220;that shouldn&#8217;t have happened to you&#8221;, even as they circle the wagons for Tambor. Although <a href="https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/999595574306459648">Bateman</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/999595735212609536">later</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/999595973553852416">apologized</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/999596036451717122">on Twitter</a> for mansplaining, it seems like they haven&#8217;t really been listening to their colleagues and peers over the past several months about what it might be like being a women on the set of one of these shows.</p>]]>

<p>Ama is a short film that was written, directed, and performed by freediver Julie Gautier.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ama is a silent film. It tells a story everyone can interpret in their own way, based on their own experience. There is no imposition, only suggestions.</p>

<p>I wanted to share my biggest pain in this life with this film. For this is not too crude, I covered it with grace. To make it not too heavy, I plunged it into the water.</p>

<p>I dedicate this film to all the women of the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is really beautiful. Watch it all the way through&#8230;the end is not to be missed. (via <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/">swissmiss</a>)</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>As he does every year, voracious reader Bill Gates has <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2018">recommended five books worth reading this summer</a>. Gates&#8217; recommendations often have a <a href="https://kottke.org/18/03/i-recommend-that-you-read-the-wizard-and-the-prophet">Wizard</a> bent and the video he produced for the list probably had a greater budget than the amount I&#8217;ve spent on running kottke.org over the past 5 years:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwGbwYAfSmg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The book I&#8217;m most curious about is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316392006/ref=nosim/0sil8">Origin Story: A Big History of Everything</a> by David Christian. I&#8217;ve long wanted to check out <a href="https://www.bighistoryproject.com/home">his Big History course</a> (due to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/so-bill-gates-has-this-idea-for-a-history-class.html">another Gates rec</a>) and this seems like a good way to do that.</p>

<blockquote><p>David created my favorite course of all time, Big History. It tells the story of the universe from the big bang to today&#8217;s complex societies, weaving together insights and evidence from various disciplines into a single narrative. If you haven&#8217;t taken Big History yet, Origin Story is a great introduction. If you have, it&#8217;s a great refresher. Either way, the book will leave you with a greater appreciation of humanity&#8217;s place in the universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are his four other recommendations:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501139150/ref=nosim/0sil8">Leonardo da Vinci</a> by Walter Isaacson.<br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812985400/ref=nosim/0sil8">Lincoln in the Bardo</a> by George Saunders.<br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399592067/ref=nosim/0sil8">Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I&#8217;ve Loved</a> by Kate Bowler.<br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250107814/ref=nosim/0sil8">Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&#8217;re Wrong About the World - and Why Things Are Better Than You Think</a> by Hans Rosling.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Back at the end of 2010, Ben Greenman <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/songs-of-the-years">created a playlist</a> for the New Yorker&#8217;s holiday party that featured one song from each year of the magazine&#8217;s existence ordered chronologically.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/tom.whitwell/playlist/4H0GZRHX1o8KO6m2gi8FPd" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></p>

<blockquote><p>At the party, the mix worked like a charm. Jazz and blues greeted the early arrivals, and as the party picked up, the mood became romantic (thanks to the big-band and vocal recordings of the late thirties and forties), energetic (thanks to early rock and roll like Fats Domino and Jackie Brenston in the early fifties), funky (James Brown in 1973, Stevie Wonder in 1974), and kitschy (the eighties), after which it erupted into a bright riot of contemporary pop and hip-hop (Rihanna! Kanye! M.I.A.! Lil Jon!).</p></blockquote>

<p>After Greenman&#8217;s list was published, others created playlists from it on Rdio, YouTube, and Spotify. I listened to this playlist a lot on Rdio back then; it was the perfect way to time travel through the 20th and early 21st centuries in just a few hours.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the list yesterday after <a href="https://twitter.com/lauraolin/status/998944952842375169">Laura Olin asked about favorite Spotify playlists</a> and discovered that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/tom.whitwell/playlist/4H0GZRHX1o8KO6m2gi8FPd">Tom Whitwell&#8217;s playlist</a> was still around. He&#8217;d created it back in the early days of streaming music services, when Spotify was available only in Europe, so some of the songs had gone missing and others, like those by Michael Jackson & The Beatles, who didn&#8217;t allow their music on streaming services then. With Whitwell&#8217;s kind permission, I went in and tidied up the list, finding the proper song for every year but 1993 (&#8220;Return of the Crazy One,&#8221; by Digital Underground, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVuP3UXJx4Q">available on YouTube</a>&#8230;on the playlist it&#8217;s represented by &#8220;Doowutchyalike&#8221;).</p>

<p>Not content to have the list trapped in amber for eternity, I emailed Greenman to see if he had any thoughts on music from the intervening years. Although he&#8217;s no longer a staffer at the New Yorker, he generously sent me his selections for 2011-2018.<sup id="fnref:1527082280"><a href="#fn:1527082280" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>2011: &#8220;Rolling in the Deep&#8221; by Adele<br />
2012: &#8220;Call Me Maybe&#8221;by Carly Rae Jepsen<br />
2013: &#8220;Get Lucky&#8221; by Daft Punk<br />
2014: &#8220;Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)&#8221; by Run the Jewels<br />
2015: &#8220;WTF&#8221; by Missy Elliott<br />
2016: &#8220;Hotline Bling&#8221; by Drake<br />
2017: &#8220;Humble&#8221; by Kendrick Lamar<br />
2018: &#8220;This is America&#8221; by Childish Gambino</p>

<p>You can listen to the full playlist embedded above or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/tom.whitwell/playlist/4H0GZRHX1o8KO6m2gi8FPd">here on Spotify</a>. Greenman shared some thoughts on updating the list:</p>

<blockquote><p>The original list was occasioned by a party: the magazine&#8217;s 85th anniversary. Almost a decade has passed, and many things have changed. It feels like a less celebratory time, darker and less hopeful in some ways. But pop music persists. In extending the list from 2010 to the present, I tried to think about how those short bursts of sound still give us moments of joy, and how certain bursts attach themselves to certain moments in history.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love this playlist and am so glad it&#8217;s back and updated. Big thanks to <a href="http://bgreenman.com/">Ben</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TomWhitwell">Tom</a> for making this happen.</p>

<p>P.S. If you duplicate this playlist on Apple Music, Tidal, etc., send me a link. Or even better, if you&#8217;re inspired to create your own Songs of the Years playlist, send along those links too. I would love to hear alternate musical journeys through that era &#8212; e.g. playlists featuring only black artists or only women would be amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> John Stokvis <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/the-songs-of-the-years-1925-2018/pl.u-6ArGvfKo7B3">recreated the playlist on Apple Music</a>. Apple had the correct Digital Underground song, but not De La Soul&#8217;s &#8220;Me, Myself & I&#8221;, so Stokvis subbed in &#8220;She Drives Me Crazy&#8221; from The Fine Young Cannibals. <a href="https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXynddLRL1ZrIskamdbcMO5nydqhksiBBGIoiMAFVEB6PjdFbXA1ZD09rZDWmpebF4vEVfLv7k1PquR4QWMldIoy1lonlwA==">Here&#8217;s the Google Play playlist</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/neuroboy/status/999357986496802816">@neuroboy</a>&#8230;looks like Google has every song.</p>

<p>A bit off-topic but still within rhyming distance, Aaron Coleman made <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/aaroncoleman0/playlist/476j8Kd0eoecsJQgRGmK41">a playlist of songs with years in the title from 1952-2031</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/aaroncoleman0/status/999292993017405440">He acknowledges</a> that some of the songs are &#8220;terrible&#8221;.</p>

<ol><li class="footnote" id="fn:1527082280"><p>I convinced him to put Drake in there, so if you&#8217;re not feeling &#8220;Hotline Bling&#8221; for 2016, you can blame me. (My rationale: Drake was <em>it</em> for those few years, so you have to have him on there somewhere. Besides, it&#8217;s tough to pick just one song from &#8220;Lemonade&#8221; and it&#8217;s not on Spotify anyway.)</p><p>Also, May is a bit early to choose a song for 2018, but &#8220;This is America&#8221; might hold up. If it doesn&#8217;t, maybe Greenman can revisit at the end of the year.<a href="#fnref:1527082280" title="return to article">&#x21A9;</a><p></li></ol>]]>
