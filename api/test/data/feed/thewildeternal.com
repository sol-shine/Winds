				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey! We just pushed out our firstÂ patch for The Wild Eternal!</p>
<p>There areÂ some treats for you to discover out in the foggy wilderness which may help clear up some things at the end of the game. In addition, we&#8217;ve madeÂ a large number of mostly minor bug fixes and adjustments to improve usability, and have worked toÂ polish some aspects of gameplay, graphics, and the UI.</p>
<p>We want your experience in The Wild Eternal to be as good and polished as it possibly can be, so if you have any trouble at all with the game, please donâ€™t hesitate to bring those issues to our attention!</p>
<h2>Version 1.1.1a</h2>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
<ul>
<li>Befriended rats now have a bit more to offer you.</li>
<li>Mysterious statues might be more helpful now, instead of just being creepy.</li>
<li>Pogostags are now considerably less demanding, and hopefully a bit more fun to be around.</li>
<li>A new type of strange stone statue can be found throughout the world. The big ones appear&#8230;hungry?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Graphics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Various polish and improvements to characters and lighting.</li>
<li>Fog effects have been polished and improved.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adjustments were made to make for a more stable experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added support for more unconventional resolutions.</li>
<li>Added ability to disable gamepad input via Options/Controls menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey! So, the game&#8217;s out&#8230;now what?</p>
<p>Welp, now we are focusing on the very uncomfortable task of self promotion and marketing! We aren&#8217;t great at this, so if you like the game, please help us get the word out in whatever corner of the web (or reality) that you call home. In addition, we&#8217;ve managed to get some great <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/554810/#app_reviews_hash">user reviews</a> on Steam, but could always use more <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also been busyÂ fixing bugs that have been reported in the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/554810/discussions/4/">support forum</a>, and have made some smallÂ improvements to the play experience. So expect a small patch in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Fan Art</h2>
<p>Catching us completely off-guard this weekend, we received our first fan art. We love fan art, we desire more! Please send some in and we&#8217;ll post it on the blog!</p>
<p>The first item is a poem! AÂ very kind gentleman named Carson Gardner wrote a wonderful poem about us and our game. Thank you Carson!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SOMEONE DID</strong><br />
by Carson Gardner</p>
<p>Why canâ€™t some Dig. Dev. create<br />
fun game software unique from the gate?<br />
With cool moves and great karma,<br />
where you donâ€™t have to arm a<br />
stone-cold killer to better your fate?</p>
<p>Why ainâ€™t there some Steam release<br />
trading boredom and terror for peace?<br />
Freeing each Sam and Sara<br />
in our ego-damned era<br />
of gamepads from a sniperâ€™s valise?</p>
<p>Why wonâ€™t some code engineer<br />
find the guts to at last pioneer<br />
wise/kind flora and fauna,<br />
better press for nirvana?<br />
Someone didâ€”The Wild Eternal is here!</p>
<hr />
<p>And then we have aÂ super nice watercolor of The Lord of Dreams, by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKubliest">The Kubliest</a>.<br />
<img class="alignnone wp-image-1264 size-medium" src="http://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C9WIHvjVYAMv1-A-225x300.jpg" alt="The Lord of Dreams, by The Kubliest" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C9WIHvjVYAMv1-A-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C9WIHvjVYAMv1-A-488x650.jpg 488w, https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C9WIHvjVYAMv1-A-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C9WIHvjVYAMv1-A.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s all for the time being, but we&#8217;ll be sure to post some patch notes and other updates as they come <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=MerrySnappyBarnacle ></div>It is theÂ early 1600&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="post-title">You are an old woman named Ananta who has fled a life of suffering in search for lasting peace in the Himalayan wild. After a traumatic life, you long to escape the cycle of reincarnation so that you may finally rest.</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=BigheartedFittingCottontail ></div>Your defiance of reincarnation has landed you in a lush, deserted wilderness covered in fog. A fox-shaped demigod agrees to help you escape your fate, but only if youâ€™ll help him in return.</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=ThankfulSelfreliantBurro ></div>To escape the cycle of reincarnation, the fox asks you to collect crystalline keys from each of the landmarks that poke up above the fog. These keys unlock sealed doors to other forests where you&#8217;ll (supposedly) find what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=WiltedAccomplishedAnhinga ></div>Beneath the fog, the wilderness is an overgrown labyrinth. Every forked path is a challenge to remember where you&#8217;ve been and where you&#8217;re going. Obstacles and critters will often block your way, forcing you to confront them or choose another path.</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=AggressiveInsidiousArchaeopteryx ></div>Additionally, the forests are also filled with content designed to distract you and get you lost. Ancient artifacts and hidden shrines have a particularly alluring pull.</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=PassionateBlondGoldeneye ></div>Offering these artifacts as tribute will bestow you with a powerful blessing. Each shrine will reveal one or two unique blessings, and each blessing is transformative in its own right. For instance, a frail old woman is no mountaineer, right?</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=AthleticOccasionalEmperorpenguin ></div>Wrong! With the &#8220;Descender&#8221; blessing, you can slide safely down even the steepest of cliffs. There are over 20 unique blessings to discover, as well as a bunch of critters to meet, tools to augment, an intricate story to unravel, a relaxing soundtrack to carry you through colorful atmospheric landscapes, and much more!</p>
<p class="post-title"><div class='gfyitem' data_title=false data_autoplay=false data_controls=false data_expand=false data_id=AdmirableSecretHarlequinbug ></div>You can buy The Wild Eternal on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/554810">Steam </a>for $14.99 with the 25% early-adopter discount on April 13th. Happy hiking and we&#8217;ll see you on the trails!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m not stressed out by that AT ALL. JK I am stressed, but I&#8217;m also relieved, and proud!</p>
<p>The Wild Eternal arrives on Windows PC (via Steam and Humble Store) on <strong>April 13, 2017</strong>. That&#8217;s like, Â soon! For those of you in the back, I repeat, louder:</p>
<h2>The Wild Eternal<br />
April 13, 2017 on Windows PC</h2>
<p><iframe width="474" height="267" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIU0s4euaX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date announcement, we are sharingÂ an environmental teaser from the first level. It&#8217;s always been very important to us that each level has a unique emotional tone and theme, which we primarily convey through the use of color, environmental design, and audio design. The first level&#8217;s theme is Mystery, let us know if you think the teaser hits the mark!</p>
<h3>Pre-Orders</h3>
<p>The game is nowÂ available for pre-order onÂ the websiteÂ for a discounted $14.99, this discount will last only through launch weekend as a thanks to our supporters.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t fully committed yet, you can always <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/554810">wishlist the game on steam</a> and decide later!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while huh? The blog&#8217;sÂ grown a bit dormant, but we&#8217;ve been pretty active on twitter sharing little updates and gameplay videos etc!Â Hopefully if you are interested in the game you&#8217;ve been seeingÂ our progress posted atÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWildEternal">@TheWildEternal</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Website Update</strong></h2>
<p>You may have noticed we have a new website, sans trailer (Casey made the website, is still working on the trailer, is currently writing this blog post). We feel pretty okay about it.</p>
<h2>Bit Bash</h2>
<p>We showed the game at Bit Bash in Chicago a couple of weeks ago, which was fantastic and lovely!Â We got to watch a bunch of people play The Wild Eternal in an environment that isn&#8217;t super conducive to our type of game. Festivals tend to be high energy, and high energy party/multiplayer games tend to be the best fit forÂ that environment.</p>
<p>We actually went into Bit Bash fully aware of this.Â Scott threwÂ together a festival-focusedÂ demo which we hoped would getÂ players quickly into a few different areas with some blessings and a goal. It was okay. We were able to get players into the game relatively quickly but they didn&#8217;t necessarily have enough context to really understand their motivations or care about what they were doing. FolksÂ still seemed to enjoy it though, so it was all good. We also played some great games and met some fantastic people while we were there! If you are in the Chicago area, I recommend going to any future Bashes they put on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s aÂ little editor script that reorders components on GameObjects to be in a fixed order (scripts use alphabetical base class before MonoBehaviour).</p>
<p><span id="more-981"></span></p>
<p>I have only tested this on Unity 4.6. Â If you are running another version, please verify that the script works in the comment section.</p>
<p>Note that I have opted to skip all camera-bearing GameObjects as they can posses MonoBehaviours that call OnRenderImage, which is an order-dependent method.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>To minimize any performance costs of polling, I decided that reordering need only take place when a new GameObject is selected. Adding new components, removing components, or moving components, will not immediately be reordered; you&#8217;ll have to change selection targets.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Not all component types are supported by default, as there are simply too many across the various versions of Unity, not to mention any that you might have created yourself. But unknown types will elicit a Debug Warning to remind you to add them in.</p>
<h2>Order</h2>
<p>Order is handled by specifyingÂ the priority (integer) value for each component type. Ties are then handled alphabetically according to the type name. Here&#8217;s what the order methodÂ looks like. You&#8217;ll want to add support for your own (Component) types here:</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">Â  private static int? GetOrder(Component component)
 {
 // physics
 if (component is Collider) return 100;
 if (component is Rigidbody) return 101;
 if (component is Joint) return 102;

 // renderers
 if (component is MeshFilter) return 200;
 if (component is Projector) return 201;
 if (component is Renderer) return 202;
 if (component is Animation) return 203;

 // lights
 if (component is Light) return 300;

 // nav mesh
 if (component is NavMeshAgent) return 400;
 if (component is NavMeshObstacle) return 401;

 // particles
 if (component is ParticleSystem) return 500;

 // environment
 if (component is Tree) return 600;

 // scripts
 if (component is MonoBehaviour)
 {
 int order = 1000;

 // custom script ordering goes here
 // if (component is SpeciallyOrderedMonoBehaviourSubclass) order += 1;

 return order;
 }

 // warning
 Debug.LogWarning(&quot;Force Component Order: &quot; + component.GetType().Name + &quot; component is not supported.&quot;);
 return null;
 }</pre>

</ul>
<h2>Update!</h2>
<p>The above code works, but for complex scenes will cause the editor to hitch when selecting or de-selecting prefab instances that have colliders and several copies in the scene. I&#8217;ve made some minor changes to the script that push it into the Transform component&#8217;s context menu rather than executing all the time. You can find my updated source here: http://pastebin.com/37fDAnh4</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by a question posted on Reddit (<a title="Read Only Parameter with SerializeField" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/2iymrg/read_only_parameter_with_serializefield_and/" target="_blank">Read Only Parameter with SerializeField</a>), I realized that I don&#8217;t have a way of communicating to other developers on my team which fields are not designed to be modified while playing in the editor!Â So I decided to solve this problem by adding a new attribute [Immutable] which disables fields in the inspector.</p>
<p><span id="more-643"></span></p>
<p>The attribute has two usage patterns: [Immutable], which causes the field to become greyed-out (disabled) when the editor is running, and [Immutable(false)], which causes the field to be greyed-out always (the optional parameter is called isEditable). The attribute is veryÂ simple, but useful. Use it well! You might also find this a nice way to learn the syntax for writingÂ your own attributes and property drawers if you haven&#8217;t explored that yet.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">[SerializeField] [Immutable] private int _inventorySize = 10;
[SerializeField] [Immutable(false)] private int _inventorySearchCountÂ = 3;</pre>
<p>This first example is indicative of a system which initializes the inventory system when Awake is called (instantiating enough slots, etc). We don&#8217;t want anyone changing this at runtime from inside the editor.</p>
<p>The second is something I wanted to be able to do to protect myself from forgetting how something works without exposing the system to additional dangers. Imagine a search feature that looks through the inventory in some potentially CPU-heavy way. I want to limit how many times this code executes before giving up, but I don&#8217;t want to hard-code the number and forget it exists, or have to open the code to find out. Still, I don&#8217;t want anyone to change it without know exactly what they&#8217;re doing. This forces future-me to go into the code to change the value, but I won&#8217;t forget it exists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime last week I took on the task of figuring out how to get the Unity3D Windows Standalone Player to play <em>The Wild Eternal</em> in a fullscreen borderless window. The only solution I could find was one that required adding a command line argument to theÂ executable. Not exactly user-friendly&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>Below is my solution to this problem, which began as aÂ simple fullscreen borderless window toggle but became a general purpose resolution controller. The system remains fairly simple, but itÂ can toggle display modes, resolutions and control the position of the window carefully (even when borderless). It will also guess at the best display settings for a user, and save most of their settings (though you will likely wish to integrate into your own save system).</p>
<figure id="attachment_622" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.thewildeternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ResolutionControllerDemo.png"><img class="wp-image-622 size-full" src="http://www.thewildeternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ResolutionControllerDemo.png" alt="Resolution Controller Demo" width="810" height="632" srcset="https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ResolutionControllerDemo.png 810w, https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ResolutionControllerDemo-650x507.png 650w, https://www.thewildeternal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ResolutionControllerDemo-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The test build. I expect others will use their own GUI, but this example provides a useful reference for interfacing with the ResolutionController.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>I found that I needed to use the windows API (user32.dll) to do this, and unfortunately ran into a few problems. I resolved them, but the resolution required deviating from some statements in the windows API&#8217;s documentation (scary!)! Thanks to a handful of volunteers, I have tested this algorithm on ~30 unique Windows machines spanning 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7, and Windows 8. Of the 30-some tests, 100% had identical results. Comforting. The details of what is scary is outlined very carefully in the code in the <strong>WindowsHandler.TrySetDisplay</strong> method.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This is repeated at the header of the ResolutionController.cs script in the shared code, so don&#8217;t feel a need to commit it to memory immediately.</p>
<p>For exclusive fullscreen mode, DirectX 9 games must put theirÂ Project&#8217;s <em>D3D9 Fullscreen Mode</em> in <em>ExclusiveMode</em>, not <em>FullscreenWindow</em>. DirectX 11 games cannot access exclusive fullscreen mode at all due to how it is implemented in Unity. This is likely not a problem as exclusive mode is only necessary for smallÂ GPU-related performance considerations, which most DirectX 11 games probably view as negligible. For those who don&#8217;t know, as I didn&#8217;t, exclusive mode is a mode where the rest of the windows explorer is not rendered (on that display), which can reduceÂ GPU and CPU loads.</p>
<p>I am more than happy to answer any questions in the comments section below. Please let me know of any unexpected behavior or bugs.</p>
