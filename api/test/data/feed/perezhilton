<p>In an email to the <em><a href="http://goo.gl/KAxQeu" target="_blank">Kansas City Star</a></em> on Tuesday, <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kate-spade/" target="_blank"><strong>Kate Spade</strong></a>'s older sister -- <strong>Reta Saffo</strong> -- says the handbag designer suffered from mental illness for the last three or four years, and says her reported suicide "was not<i> </i>unexpected by me."</p>
<p>As <a href="http://perezhilton.com/cocoperez/2018-06-05-kate-spade-found-dead-apparent-suicide-55#.Wxb1WGaZMWr" target="_blank">we reported</a>, the fashion legend was found in her New York apartment by a housekeeper at 10:30 a.m. EST, after she reportedly hung herself. The 55-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://perezhilton.com/galleries/stars-lost-died-2018/?id=521571" target="_blank"><strong>Related: Stars We Lost In 2018</strong></a></p>
<p>According to Saffo, Spade reportedly self-medicated with alcohol, and seemed fixated on <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robin-williams/" target="_blank"><strong>Robin Williams</strong></a>' suicide by hanging when it happened in August 2014. She told the newspaper: </p>
<blockquote><p>
"I think there was a plan even as far back as then."
</p></blockquote>
<p>After the publication posted a story about Spade's death, Saffo emailed the <em>Star</em> saying they misspelled Kate's childhood nickname, Katy.</p>
<p>Although she was asked to do a phone interview, Saffo declined because she reportedly took a sedative. (She noted that her husband is a medical doctor.)</p>
<p>In the email, Saffo said she tried to get Kate into treatment, but the designer "chickened out" as she was worried with how her hospitalization might affect the image of her brand. </p>
<blockquote><p>
"I will say this was not unexpected by me. I'd flown out to Napa and NYC several times in the past 3-4 years to help her to get the treatment she needed (inpatient hospitalization). She was always a very excitable little girl and I felt all the stress/pressure of her brand (KS) may have flipped the switch where she eventually became full-on manic depressive... I'd come so VERY close to getting her to go in for treatment (to the same place Catherine Zeta-Jones went for her successful bipolar treatment program). I'd spoken with them on the phone (not telling them exactly who the patient would be). They agreed to fly in and talk with her and take her with them to the treatment center... She was all set to go — but then chickened out by morning. I even said I (would) go with her and be a 'patient' too (she liked that idea) I said we could talk about it all — our childhood, etc. That I could help her fill in any blanks she might have... That seemed to make her more comfortable, and we'd get sooo close to packing her bags, but — in the end, the 'image' of her brand (happy-go-lucky Kate Spade) was more important for her to keep up. She was definitely worried about what people would say if they found out."'
</p></blockquote>
<p>Although her husband <strong>Andy Spade</strong> reportedly tried to persuade Kate to seek help, "nothing ever came of it."</p>
<p>After numerous failed attempts, Saffo ultimately stopped trying. </p>
<blockquote><p>
"After numerous attempts, I finally let go... Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, 'Reta, I know you hate funerals and don't attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!' I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not."'
</p></blockquote>
<p>In regards to Robin Williams' death, Saffo said Kate heard about his passing at a hotel in Santa Fe. </p>
<blockquote><p>
"We were freaked out/saddened... but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Saffo ended her email remembering her "kind" and "funny" younger sister. </p>
<blockquote><p>
"She was a dear little person. So dear — so kind, so funny. I'll miss our 6-7-hr-long phone conversations between NY and NM... I'm off to bed for a good cry."
</p></blockquote>

Not knowing the lyrics to "God Bless America" isn't a really bad thing. UNLESS you're hosting a patriotism party, and the announcer says to sing the song to honor the country. And you just spent the last year blasting a group for not being patriotic. And you're the president.<br />

<p>Sticking by your husband isn't always easy...</p>
<p>In <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kanye-west/" target="_blank"><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>'s new song <em>Wouldn't Leave</em> off his new album <em>Ye</em>, the musician reveals how wife <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kim-kardashian/" target="_blank"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> reacted to his comments about <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2018-05-01-kanye-west-slavery-choice-tmz-live-video-interview/?from=post" target="_blank">"slavery" being "a choice."</a></p>

<p>He raps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<em>My wife callin', screamin', say, 'We 'bout to lose it all!'</em> / <em>Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe</em> / <em>Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave.</em>"'</p></blockquote>
<p>On Monday at the 2018 <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/cfda-awards/" target="_blank"><strong>CFDA Awards</strong></a>, the <em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kuwtk/" target="_blank"><strong>KUWTK</strong></a></em> star told <em><a href="http://goo.gl/2yy7JY" target="_blank">ET Online</a></em> that she, in fact, cried and fought with him over his controversial words.</p>
<p>The reality TV personality confessed: </p>
<blockquote><p>
"Did I cry about it? Did I fight about it? Yeah... That's not stuff we put on social media -- I'm not going to start tweeting what my thoughts are, but we have those moments and that was the one song that he didn't really play for me until the last minute, so I heard that last minute and it meant a lot to me... I really like that song... But yeah, we have different views sometimes, but that's my husband, you know?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Although she heard that song at the last minute, Kardashian was present for most of the recording sessions.</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I was in the room for making all of the songs and hearing things and it's a really fascinating process, especially since he scrapped his whole album and redid it in the last two weeks and just came up with all new songs... I left to go home for, like, two days and then I come back and it was a whole new album. It's fascinating to see the process."</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2018-06-04-kanye-west-ye-apple-music-spotify-charts" target="_blank">we reported</a>, a day after the album dropped, songs from the LP dominated the <strong>Apple Music</strong> and <strong>Spotify</strong> charts.</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I'm so happy that it's been well-received because I've seen him go through a lot and he's just the most genuine person... He might say things that might get misinterpreted and people don't see the context behind it, but I always know his heart, so I'm glad that it was really well-received."</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, Kim credits Kanye for helping her find her voice as a woman.</p>
<blockquote><p>
"He is so confident... He would always build up my confidence to be who I want to be, and so I'll voice my opinion when I think there's something that is maybe done wrong -- or even if the messaging is right [and] the communication isn't quite there to figure that out."</p></blockquote>
<p>She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"But I always believe and trust in him that he will always eventually explain himself because I know it's hard... I know what he really means when he says something and I know people will too at some point."</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the drama, these two truly love each other!</p>
